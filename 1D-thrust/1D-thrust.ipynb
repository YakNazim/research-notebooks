      "Real spaceflight dynamics are complex. There are only a few basic forces involved, but some of them (namely air resistance) are non-conservative and tricky. In order to make a useful, accurate model of spaceflight you have to build a complex numerical approximation. However there is no need to be too complicated too quickly. A great place to start is to find an analytical solution for a rocket, solving for the height it will travel. Put everything in the 'up' axis and ignoring a ton of things will result in an easy place to start.\n",

      "The true simplest case is a point-mass rocket that is in free space with no gravity, air-resistance and has a simplified model of propulsion. Describing this situation mathematically results in the classic [Tsiolkovsky rocket equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation).\n",
